# recommendation by organisers
based on [this](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/guidelines-presenter/?utm_source=sendgrid.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=website): *Oral Presentations (15 minutes plus 5 minutes for questions and changeover): Short conversation starters which provide enough information to encourage the audience to engage and seek further information.*

# todo
- put links for lightning talk and BoF
- put links to NeSI and CeR

# Outline

::: {.incremental}
some intro
:::

## This talk's focus

- Lightning Talk earlier today was mainly about answering 'what' we did and metrics
- This talk is focused on the delivery
  - two perspectives: CeR and NeSI 
- BoF (right after this talk) will be a broader discussion of a similar topic 

## This talk's Goal

- share our experience
  - lessons learned
  - what went well, what didn't, how we would do it differently
- emphasising on some best-practices
- encourage others to do similar things
  - because *the time is now*
  - you need less resources than you might expect

## This talk's Structure

- we (CeR and NeSI) won't talk about these topics one after the other
- we picked some perspectives and will share them in parallel

## How the ML sessions were executed

- CeR and NeSI independently made the decision to base the workshops on existing material (The Carpentries) and ([Scikit-learn Tutorial(https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_tutorial) by 
[Jake Vanderplas]](https://github.com/jakevdp))
- The underlying idea was to start with foundational ML aspects and to build up
- different session times
  - Column left: show details of ML101 and ML201
  - Column right: show details of Carp Sessions
- Maybe a comparison of content covered

## Resoures used

- Colab
- JupyterHub?

# One goal -- 2 approaches

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- Introduce researchers to Machine Learning <br> and Deep Learning
- Teaching by doing, i.e. hands-on interactive workshops
- Not a full course, more an *ice-breaker*
- Yet provide practical knowledge to get started

TODO add here a nice image :)

Let's dissect some key aspects of the 2 approaches!

# Some numbers

<!-- goal: give some credibility to our recommendations -->

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

**UoA workshops**

- TODO describe modules
- TODO add link to Lightning talk

:::
::: {.column}

**NeSI workshops**

<!-- TODO double check all the numbers -->
- audience: Aotearoa -- NZ researchers
- ML 101
  - intro to Machine Learning
  - started in 2021
  - 7 workshops (in person, online, hybrid)
  - TODO attendees in total
- ML 102
  - intro to Deep Learning (CNNs)
  - started in 2022
  - 2 workshops (online)
  - TODO attendees in total

**UoA workshops**

TODO content

::: {.column}

**NeSI workshops**

- ML 101: 6 hours
  - at first in one day
  - now split over 2 mornings
- ML 102: 3 hours
- independent workshops
- almost always online
  - 1 in person (wifi issues)
  - 1 hybrid (require more organisation)

:::

TODO here some recommendations: make it online, split/shorter sessions

# Material

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

**UoA workshops**

TODO material and what has been done to it

:::
::: {.column}

**NeSI workshops**

- ML 101
  - Scikit-Learn workshop from Jake Vanderplas
  - online recordings (very good to rehearse)
  - Jupyter notebook based
  - very few changes (updated package version)
- ML 102
  - TensorFlow tutorials
  - Jupyter notebook based
  - added an introduction
  - added section to submit a Slurm job

:::
::::

TODO here some recommendations: reuse/adapt content, don't start from scratch

# Content

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

**Machine **

- supervised vs. unsupervised
  - regression, classification
  - cluster, dimensionality reduction
- ensemble models (random forests)
- validation (train/test, cross-validation)

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

TODO add a nice image

:::
::::

Recommendation: **resist the temptation of MLP (multi-layer perceptron)** for an intro

- require more notions (architecture, training, data preprocessing, ...)
- keep it for Deep Learning introduction

# Audience

TODO some more generic recommendations around EOIs, selection process, pre-workshop communication, teaching crew (get helpers)

# Platform

TODO Google Colab, Jupyter-on-NeSI, no need of GPU to start (or small ones on Colab available)

# Recommendations

- use existing material
- don't be afraid to use Colab, etc. you don't need fancy GPUs, even though you can have some
- decision if Python is prerequisite or not?!

# How to get in touch

- email abc
