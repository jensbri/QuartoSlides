# About this talk

::: {.incremental}
- We want to inform about our experience with Machine Learning (ML) workshops
- We want to share some recommendations
:::

<!-- REMOVED BY MAXIME (who thinks that this could be condensed in the "About this talk" slide :D

## This talk's focus

- The [Lightning Talk earlier today](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/developing-a-carpentries-style-machine-learning-workshop/) was mainly about answering '*what*' we[^1] did and metrics
- [This current talk](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/upskilling-researchers-in-machine-learning/) is focused on the **delivery**
  - two perspectives: CeR and NeSI 
- [BoF](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/ai-skill-training-pathway-bridging-gaps-and-fostering-inclusivity/) (right after this talk) will be a *broader discussion* of a similar topic 


[^1]: by "*we*" is ([CeR - Centre for eResearch](https://eresearch.auckland.ac.nz/)) and [NeSI (National eScience Infrastructure)](https://www.nesi.org.nz/)

## This talk's Goal

- share our experience
  - lessons learned
  - along the lines of: What went well, what didn't, how we would do it differently
- emphasising on some best-practices
- encourage others to do similar things
  - because *the time is now*
  - you need less resources than you might expect

## This talk's Structure

- we won't talk about this from a NeSI vs. CeR perspective sequentially
- we rather picked some perspectives and will share them in parallel

-->

# One goal -- 2 approaches

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

- Introduce researchers to Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Start with **foundational** ML aspects and to build up from there
- Research field agnostic
- **Hands-on** approach (teaching by doing)
  - **no** show and tell of existing commercial solutions
  - **no** theoretical lectures
  - **no** deep dive into the maths behind ML
- Not an exhaustive course but make attendees confident to try things by themselves

Let's dissect some key aspects of the 2 approaches!

# Execution-phase of the ML workshops

## How the ML sessions were executed

- CeR and NeSI independently made the decision to base the workshops on **existing material** ([The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html)) and ([Scikit-learn Tutorial](https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_tutorial) by 
[Jake Vanderplas](https://github.com/jakevdp))

## Resoures used

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

**NeSI**

<!-- TODO: check if this is all correct, just from memory -->
- (several iterations of the workshops) *in-person* with own challenges then online only event: Zoom.us
- byod
- Jupyter Hub

:::

::: {.column}

**CeR**

- online only event: Zoom.us
- byod
- deviation from 'The Carpentries': No local Python installs
- Google Colab

# Some numbers

<!-- goal: give some credibility to our recommendations -->


## Audience and Runs -- 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

**UoA workshops**

- audience: The University of Auckland (UoA) researchers
- two runs
  - Run #1: March 2023
  - Run #2: September 2023
- well-received: filtering by mandatory Expression of Interest (EoI)
  - about 100 applications for 30 spots
- TODO add Zoom participants plot

:::
::: {.column}

**NeSI workshops**

<!-- TODO double check all the numbers -->
- audience: Aotearoa -- NZ researchers
- ML 101
  - intro to Machine Learning
  - started in 2021
  - 7 workshops (in person, online, hybrid)
  - TODO attendees in total
- ML 102
  - intro to Deep Learning (CNNs)
  - started in 2022
  - 2 workshops (online)
  - TODO attendees in total

# Schedule

<!-- so this is purely about the hours and the split of content over these hours -->

## UoA wokshops

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- Run #1: 
  - 4h Python
  - 4h Intro ML
  - ... PUT CORRECT NUMBERS HERE
- Run #2: 
  - --4h Python--
  - 8h Intro ML
  - ... PUT CORRECT NUMBERS HERE

## NeSI workshops

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- ML 101: 6 hours
  - at first in one day
  - now split over 2 mornings
- ML 102: 3 hours
- independent workshops
- almost always online
  - 1 in person (wifi issues)
  - 1 hybrid (require more organisation)

## Recommendations

- make it online
- split/shorter sessions (bearing in mind the scheduling-challenges for researchers)
- sticking to break-schedule
- following best practices for online audience
  - [Webinar: Tips & tricks for hosting a successful online event](https://youtu.be/XTeCHUZ2H_w?si=OD4GDRNSV460zK7O)

# Material

- An overview of the lessons that were used, adapted, enhanced:
<!-- IS THIS PREVIOUS STATEMENT WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND? -->

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

**UoA workshops**

- TODO paste the table with the linked Slides from Lightning talk

:::
::: {.column}

**NeSI workshops**

- ML 101
  - Scikit-Learn workshop from Jake Vanderplas
  - online recordings (very good to rehearse)
  - Jupyter notebook based
  - very few changes (updated package version)
- ML 102
  - TensorFlow tutorials
  - Jupyter notebook based
  - added an introduction
  - added section to submit a Slurm job

:::
::::

Overall recommendations: 
- don't reinvent the wheel
- reuse/adapt content

## Content

- this differs from the previous perspective as it is more about the abstract topics covered
<!-- IS THIS PREVIOUS STATEMENT WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND? -->

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

**Machine Learning**

- supervised vs. unsupervised
  - regression, classification
  - cluster, dimensionality reduction
- ensemble models (random forests)
- validation (train/test, cross-validation)

<!-- we should include the DeepLearning topic here, too? Or was the point for you to show: This was covered by both of us? -->
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

TODO add a nice image
<!-- WHAT KIND OF IMAGE DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?? -->

# Recommendations based on our Experience

Recommendation: **resist the temptation of MLP (multi-layer perceptron)** for an intro

- require more notions (architecture, training, data preprocessing, ...)
- keep it for Deep Learning introduction

## Audience

TODO some more generic recommendations around EOIs, selection process, pre-workshop communication, teaching crew (get helpers)

## Platform

TODO Google Colab, Jupyter-on-NeSI, no need of GPU to start (or small ones on Colab available)

# Other Recommendations

- use existing material
- don't be afraid to use Colab, etc. you don't need fancy GPUs, even though you can have some
- decision if Python is prerequisite or not?!

# How to get in touch

- email abc
- maybe a QR code or two
-
