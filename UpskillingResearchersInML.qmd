# About this talk

::: {.incremental}

::: {.incremental}
- We want to inform about our experience with Machine Learning (ML) workshops.
- We want to share some recommendations.

:::

::: {.incremental}
- The [Lightning Talk earlier today](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/developing-a-carpentries-style-machine-learning-workshop/) was mainly about answering *what* we did and metrics.
- [This current talk](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/upskilling-researchers-in-machine-learning/) is focused on the **delivery**.
- [BoF](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/ai-skill-training-pathway-bridging-gaps-and-fostering-inclusivity/) (right after this talk) will be a *broader discussion* of a similar topic.

## This talk's focus

- The [Lightning Talk earlier today](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/developing-a-carpentries-style-machine-learning-workshop/) was mainly about answering '*what*' we[^1] did and metrics
- [This current talk](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/upskilling-researchers-in-machine-learning/) is focused on the **delivery**
  - two perspectives: CeR and NeSI 
- [BoF](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/ai-skill-training-pathway-bridging-gaps-and-fostering-inclusivity/) (right after this talk) will be a *broader discussion* of a similar topic 


[^1]: by "*we*" is ([CeR - Centre for eResearch](https://eresearch.auckland.ac.nz/)) and [NeSI (National eScience Infrastructure)](https://www.nesi.org.nz/)

## This talk's Goal

- share our experience
  - lessons learned
  - along the lines of: What went well, what didn't, how we would do it differently
- emphasising on some best-practices
- encourage others to do similar things
  - because *the time is now*
  - you need less resources than you might expect

## This talk's Structure

- we won't talk about this from a NeSI vs. CeR perspective sequentially
- we rather picked some perspectives and will share them in parallel

-->

# A shared goal

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

- Introduce researchers to Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Start with **foundational** ML aspects and to build up from there
- Research field agnostic
- **Hands-on** approach (teaching by doing)
  - **no** show and tell of existing commercial solutions
  - **no** theoretical lectures
  - **no** deep dive into the maths behind ML
- Not an exhaustive course but make attendees confident to try things by themselves

# Workshops overview

<!-- goal: give some credibility to our recommendations and advise about recruitment process -->

## UoA workshops

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- Audience: The University of Auckland (UoA) researchers
- Two runs
  - Run #1: March 2023
  - Run #2: September 2023
- Well-received
  - filtering by mandatory Expression of Interest (EoI)
  - about 100 applications for 30 spots

::: {.column}

TODO add Zoom participants plot

## NeSI workshops

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

TODO picture

:::

::: {.column}

<!-- TODO double check all the numbers -->
- Audience: Aotearoa -- NZ researchers
- ML 101
  - intro to Machine Learning
  - started in 2021
  - 7 workshops (in person, online, hybrid)
  - TODO attendees in total
- ML 102
  - intro to Deep Learning (CNNs)
  - started in 2022
  - 2 workshops (online)
  - TODO attendees in total
- Mixture of direct registration and EoIs

:::
::::


## Recommendations {.center}

There will be a **lot** of interest so...

- use an Expression of Interest for registration and filter,
- 30 participants is a good number for an online training,
- expect people to not show up (if free and online).

# Platform(s)

## UoA workshops

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- online only event: Zoom.us
- byod
- deviation from 'The Carpentries': No local Python installs
- Google Colab

:::

::: {.column}

:::
::::

## NeSI workshops

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

:::

::: {.column}

- Almost always online
  - 1 in person (had wifi issues)
  - 1 hybrid (require more organisation)
- Use Jupyter-on-NeSI
  - JupyterHub platform
  - Require a NeSI account
  - ML101: 2 cores & 4 GB of RAM
  - ML102: 4 cores & 8 GB of RAM
- Use Slurm based job for GPU training (a little bit)
- Tip: make sure the Platform team does not schedule upgrades that day...

:::
::::

## Recommendations {.center}

- Make it online
- Leverage online computational platform (Google Colab, JupyterHub, Open OnDemand...)
- No need of GPU to start (or small ones on Colab available)

# Schedule

<!-- so this is purely about the hours and the split of content over these hours -->

## UoA workshops

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- Run #1: 
  - 4h Python
  - 4h Intro ML
  - ... PUT CORRECT NUMBERS HERE
- Run #2: 
  - --4h Python--
  - 8h Intro ML
  - ... PUT CORRECT NUMBERS HERE

  - 6 hours with TODO breaks
  - at first in one day
  - now split over 2 mornings
- ML 102
  - 3 hours with TODO breaks
- Independent workshops
- But organised "close" to each other

:::
::: {.column}

TODO illustration or runsheet capture

:::

## Recommendations {.center}

- Split/shorter sessions (bearing in mind the scheduling-challenges for researchers)
- Sticking to break-schedule
- Following best practices for online audience
  - TODO enumerate a bit
  - [Webinar: Tips & tricks for hosting a successful online event](https://youtu.be/XTeCHUZ2H_w?si=OD4GDRNSV460zK7O)

# Material

## UoA workshops

- [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html)
- TODO paste the table with the linked Slides from Lightning talk

## NeSI workshops

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

TODO add image

:::
::: {.column}

**NeSI workshops**

- ML 101
  - [Scikit-learn Tutorial](https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_tutorial) by 
[Jake Vanderplas](https://github.com/jakevdp)
  - online recordings (very good to rehearse)
  - Jupyter notebook based
  - very few changes (updated package version)
- ML 102
  - TensorFlow tutorials
  - Jupyter notebook based
  - added an introduction
  - added section to submit a Slurm job

:::
::::

## Recommendations {.center}

CeR and NeSI independently made the decision to base the workshops on **existing material**

- Don't reinvent the wheel
- Reuse/adapt content

<!-- should we mention notebooks? -->

# Content

<!-- this differs from the previous perspective as it is more about the abstract topics covered
     IS THIS PREVIOUS STATEMENT WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND? yes :) -->

## {.center}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

**Machine Learning**

- *Data preparation*
- Supervised vs. unsupervised learning
  - regression, classification
  - cluster, dimensionality reduction
- Ensemble models (random forests)
- Validation (train/test, cross-validation)

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

**Deep Learning**

TODO add contents from workshops

<!-- we should include the DeepLearning topic here, too? Or was the point for you to show: This was covered by both of us?
     we should add this one, good point
-->

:::
::::

## Recommendations {.center}

- **Random forest** is a **good** first non-linear model to learn
  - intuitive to understand how it works
  - good performances on tabular data
  - doesn't require too much care in terms of data preparation

- Resist the temptation of **MLP (multi-layer perceptron)** for an ML intro
  - require more notions (architecture, training, data preprocessing, ...)
  - keep it for Deep Learning introduction

# Summary

- Use Expression-of-Interest for registrations
- Make it online
- Use an online compute platform (Colab, JupyterHub or Open OnDemand at your institution)
- You don't need fancy GPUs, even though you can have some
- Re-use and adapt existing material
- Use shorter sessions and stick to breaks
- Keep MLP for the Deep Learning section, start with Random Forests

# How to get in touch

- email abc
- maybe a QR code or two
