# recommendation by organisers
based on [this](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/guidelines-presenter/?utm_source=sendgrid.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=website): *Oral Presentations (15 minutes plus 5 minutes for questions and changeover): Short conversation starters which provide enough information to encourage the audience to engage and seek further information.*

# todo
- put links for lightning talk and BoF
- put links to NeSI and CeR
- what tables and stats from the Lightning talk to include?

# About this talk

::: {.incremental}
- some intro
- maybe a ToC?

<!-- TODO upload better image, reduce margins EDIT Jens: Cropped existing version  -->

- Data Science Engineer @ NeSI
- Data Scientist @ NIWA
- Help researchers optimise and scale-up <br> their code,
- Develop ML pipelines and models,
- Organise ML and data science **training**

:::

::: {.column}

**Jens Brinkmann**

- TODO funny picture
- official title: *Senior eResearch Engagement Specialist*
- Mechanical Engineer with a background in Photography/Videography
- Support reseachers with their computational needs and training around that 

:::
::::


## This talk's focus

- The [Lightning Talk earlier today](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/developing-a-carpentries-style-machine-learning-workshop/) was mainly about answering '*what*' we[^1] did and metrics
- [This talk](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/upskilling-researchers-in-machine-learning/) is focused on the **delivery**
  - two perspectives: CeR and NeSI 
- [BoF](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/ai-skill-training-pathway-bridging-gaps-and-fostering-inclusivity/) (right after this talk) will be a *broader discussion* of a similar topic 


[^1]: *we* is CeR (Centre for eResearch) and NeSI (National eScience Infrastructure)

## This talk's Goal

- share our experience
  - lessons learned
  - what went well, what didn't, how we would do it differently
- emphasising on some best-practices
- encourage others to do similar things
  - because *the time is now*
  - you need less resources than you might expect

## This talk's Structure

- we won't talk about the previously mentioned topics *one after the other*
- we picked some perspectives and will share them in parallel

# Execution-phase of the ML workshops

- (maybe another sub toc?)

## How the ML sessions were executed

- CeR and NeSI independently made the decision to base the workshops on existing material ([The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html)) and ([Scikit-learn Tutorial(https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_tutorial) by 
[Jake Vanderplas]](https://github.com/jakevdp))
- Reasoning about what topics to cover and in what depth: Decision to started with foundational ML aspects and to build up
- different session times
  - Column left: show details of ML101 and ML201
  - Column right: show details of Carp Sessions
- Maybe a comparison of content covered

## Resoures used


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

**NeSI**
<!-- TODO: check if this is all correct, just from memory -->
- (several iterations of the workshops) *in-person* with own challenges then online only event: Zoom.us
- byod
- Jupyter Hub

:::

::: {.column}

**CeR**

- online only event: Zoom.us
- byod
- deviation from 'The Carpentries': No local Python installs
- Google Colab

:::
::::



# One goal -- 2 approaches

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- Introduce researchers to Machine Learning <br> and Deep Learning
- Teaching by doing, i.e. hands-on interactive workshops
- Unrealistic to cover topic exhaustively, more of an *ice-breaker*
- Yet provide practical knowledge to get started
  - but not a show and tell of existing commercial solutions

Let's dissect some key aspects of the 2 approaches!

# Some numbers

<!-- goal: give some credibility to our recommendations -->


## Audience and Runs

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

**UoA workshops**

- audience: The University of Auckland (UoA) researchers
- two runs
  - Run #1: March 2023
  - Run #2: September 2023
- well-received: filtering by mandatory Expression of Interest (EoI)
  - about 100 applications for 30 spots
- TODO add Zoom participants plot

:::
::: {.column}

**NeSI workshops**

<!-- TODO double check all the numbers -->
- audience: Aotearoa -- NZ researchers
- ML 101
  - intro to Machine Learning
  - started in 2021
  - 7 workshops (in person, online, hybrid)
  - TODO attendees in total
- ML 102
  - intro to Deep Learning (CNNs)
  - started in 2022
  - 2 workshops (online)
  - TODO attendees in total

:::
::::

## Schedule

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

**UoA workshops**

- Run #1: 
  - 4h Python
  - 4h Intro ML
  - ... PUT CORRECT NUMBERS HERE
- Run #2: 
  - --4h Python--
  - 8h Intro ML
  - ... PUT CORRECT NUMBERS HERE

:::
::: {.column}

**NeSI workshops**

- ML 101: 6 hours
  - at first in one day
  - now split over 2 mornings
- ML 102: 3 hours
- independent workshops
- almost always online
  - 1 in person (wifi issues)
  - 1 hybrid (require more organisation)

:::
::::

TODO here some recommendations: 

- make it online
- split/shorter sessions (bearing in mind the scheduling-challenges for researchers)

## Material

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

**UoA workshops**

- TODO WHAT copy-paste of the table of Lightning talk?

:::
::: {.column}

**NeSI workshops**

- ML 101
  - Scikit-Learn workshop from Jake Vanderplas
  - online recordings (very good to rehearse)
  - Jupyter notebook based
  - very few changes (updated package version)
- ML 102
  - TensorFlow tutorials
  - Jupyter notebook based
  - added an introduction
  - added section to submit a Slurm job

:::
::::

TODO here some recommendations: reuse/adapt content, don't start from scratch

## Content

<!-- I AM NOT SURE HOW CONTENT DIFFERS FROM MATERIAL? -->

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

**Machine Learning**

- supervised vs. unsupervised
  - regression, classification
  - cluster, dimensionality reduction
- ensemble models (random forests)
- validation (train/test, cross-validation)

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

TODO add a nice image
<!-- WHAT KIND OF IMAGE DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?? -->

:::

# Recommendations based on our Experience

Recommendation: **resist the temptation of MLP (multi-layer perceptron)** for an intro

- require more notions (architecture, training, data preprocessing, ...)
- keep it for Deep Learning introduction

## Audience

TODO some more generic recommendations around EOIs, selection process, pre-workshop communication, teaching crew (get helpers)

## Platform

TODO Google Colab, Jupyter-on-NeSI, no need of GPU to start (or small ones on Colab available)

# Other Recommendations

- use existing material
- don't be afraid to use Colab, etc. you don't need fancy GPUs, even though you can have some
- decision if Python is prerequisite or not?!

# How to get in touch

- email abc
