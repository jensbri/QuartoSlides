# Overview

- To answer the main question **"ML-Carp Workshop, what is that?"** let's answer three sub-questions:
  - Q1: **What** was done?
  - Q2: **Who** participated and how did they **feel** about it?
  - Q3: ML-Carp's **future**?
- This talk links to upcoming sessions:
  - [Upskilling researchers in Machine Learning](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/upskilling-researchers-in-machine-learning/) 
  - [BoF Session: *AI Skill Training Pathway: Bridging Gaps and Fostering Inclusivity*](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/ai-skill-training-pathway-bridging-gaps-and-fostering-inclusivity/) 



# What was done
## Background


- Machine Learning (ML) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) are without a doubt **hot topics**
- Empowering researchers to **understand and use** ML seems **rewarding**, but also **challenging**
- [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) ![The Carpentries](TheCarpentries.svg){ width=10% } offer a proven teaching-style accounting for participants with limited IT experience
  - Core aspects 
    - live-coding
    - positive attitude towards mistakes
    - minimal prerequisites
    - **maximising participant involvement**
- The [CeR (Centre for eResearch)](http://eresearch.auckland.ac.nz/) at the University of Auckland acquired funding to further develop and run a series of workshops (also referred to as *ML-Carp*)
- Two iterations (referred to as *Run #1* and *Run#2*) took place so far. In March and September 2023.

::: {layout="[[-1], [1], [-1]]"}
- 4h sessions over 4 consecutive afternoons
:::




- Depending on Maturity, sessions were run with **small changes** or **substantially (re)developed**.


- One major change was [Goolge Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) ![Colab](./Google_Colaboratory_SVG_Logo.svg){ width=3% } being used instead of local Python installs.

# Who Participated And How Did They Like It?


- Large sign-up numbers meant mandatory *expression of interest* (EOI) and filtering
- Analysis follows from two perspectives:
  - Metrics
  - Statements


## Participants' Background

## Participants Promotion/Demotion

<!-- {{< embed Plots.ipynb#participants-recommendation >}} -->
![](UpskillingResearchersInML_Assets/ParticipantsRecommend.svg)


## Participants' Feelings - Statements and Adjustments


- observation: At very end of the Runs, questions/participation/interest didn't cease!


- "***Python** lesson might be **separated***"
  - Run #2: Python was removed from the curriculum
- "*more **breaks***"
  - Run #2: better adherence to schedule
- "*stick to **one coding interface***"
  - Run #2: only Colab, VSC etc. was linked to for post-workshop engagement




:::{.callout-note}
All statements are positive phrased; overall the results confirm a poasitive appreciation.
:::



<!-- # Reflection on Run #1 and adaption
- The learning curve appeared too steep. From no coding to refined DL approaches in a few days appeared too challenging
  - (some) Python knowledge was made a prerequisite for the Run #2. That hasn't lead to a decline in registrations
  - Two (half) days of Python being removed from this run's curriculum freed up time to allow for more breaks, an even slower pace and answering more specific questions
- End of the run shouldn't imply ceasing communication with (most) participants
  - while some researchs continue to stay in touch with CeR after Run #1, to keep up the momentum of more participants, after the end of the workshop should be less of a cut and more 'faded out'
    - A curated set of links for self-study was deemed too generic with an anticipated low continued interst in fully self-motivated  
    - Slack sub channel with targeted support
    - Kaggle?
    - VSC and local Python/GPU/Nectar/... 
    - ![Comparison](ComparisonRevRun1And2.jpg) TODO: make this appear and disappear

# What participants of Run #1 said
## What 1 thing did you like and would want to see in future workshops?
- *"apply these ML techniques on the different field"*
  - hard to achieve, focus on underlying theory
- *"slower pace"*
  - removed Python from curriculum 
- *"some research paper example?"*
  - hard
- *"add some quick group exercise session or quiz"*
  - more links/examples after the run
- *"many people were online to help the students"*
  - continued with many helpers

## What 1 thing you do think we could do better?
- too fast
- separate Python 
- adhering to break schedule

  # Comparing Run #1 and #2: What metrics and people say
  - what the numbers say 
    - more people signed up (word of mouth/positive experince being shared?)
    - more of this and that
  - what the pepole say
    - instrcutors/organisers (for the sake of bervity no full quotes)
      - better balance of topics (only ML, DL vs. having to cope with Python)
    - participants
      - ... -->

# ML Carp's Future
- while specific funding (for lesson preparation and delivery) has ended, the importance of the topic continues to increase
- more sessions are planned
- maintaining momentum using dedicated [Slack sessions](https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/digital-research-skills/hacky-hour) seems promising
- Feedback about separating the Python lesson is positive
