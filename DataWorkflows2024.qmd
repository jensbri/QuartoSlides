## This session vs. related
- This session is the introduction. Let's call it **Level** :one:
  - We will mostly talk
  - Nick is the expert who taught Jens many things over the past years, we'll replicate some of the back and forth
  - We will provide you with an overview
  - you are asked to think about **examples** you'd like see used in the upcoming sessions
- You can decide if you just want to listen or if you want to follow along
  - If you want to get your hands dirty, hold your horses :horse:
  - don't miss out now
  - the next sessions will be all about hands-on experience with the tools :hammer_and_wrench:
- There is homework :briefcase: 
  - see later slides
  
<!-- TODO PUT SOME ICONS (VSC, ... GIT, ... here) -->

## Homework :briefcase: 
- Install software
<!-- put 3 tabs win,osx,linux -->
- Get a dataset (git pull/GitHub Desktop)
- run this one line, to see what if it works. 

## The support via Slack
- We have a Slack channel
- We will be available for questions
- This is a premiere, so let's see how many quesitons we can answer 

## The next session or Level :two:
- Here we will go through several steps
- We will use a real-world example
- In case you, as a group, haven't agreed on a dataset of highest relevance, to be used, we will provide one
