<!-- VERBATIM short description as posted on the resbaz website 
This comprehensive hands-on session will cover the fundamental building blocks of working with Python to analyse and visualize data. Together we'll interactively learn how to use Python to generate a plot from a csv file, getting to grips with the core functionality of the language along the way. -->

# Housekeeping
- Please mute your microphone
- Be kind
  - all details of the Code of Conduct can be found [here](https://resbaz.auckland.ac.nz/about/)
- This is a hands-on session; you should give it a go and participate actively
- 


# Expectations
- We can't teach you to be a Python expert in 
- 
- 
# Summary
	if this is something you want to learn more about, here are some resources
			- from our follow-up email
			- link to Carp session (and the carp website)
			- link to ML
		also: more for NLP (for the ones that CAI/CABLE/Humanities)



<!-- The word integer comes from the Latin integer meaning "whole" or (literally) "untouched", from in ("not") plus tangere ("to touch"). "Entire" derives from the same origin via the French word entier, which means both entire and integer -->



### to add
- [ ] demonstrate: How to get a subset of a list
	- [ ] demonstrate how to get one specific value
	- [ ] demonstrate how to append a list
- [ ] f-strings
- [ ] randomisation
- [ ] functions 
- [ ] scikit statistics
	- [ ] Inspiration from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26319259/how-to-get-a-regression-summary-in-scikit-learn-like-r-does) ``` from statsmodels.api import OLS
OLS(dataset.target,dataset.data).fit().summary()```
- [ ] for dicts just say: Key-Value-Pair
	- [ ] Use Numpy arrays for stuff that you'd use Matlab for
	- [ ] Use Pandas for things that you'd do in R otherwise
		- [ ] we import our spreadsheet into this
		- [ ] this is how we can have a look
- [ ] Get rid of while loops. No one uses them. Keep it light. Have them loop over a list of files
