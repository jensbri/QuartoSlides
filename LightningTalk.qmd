# to be removed: Info by organisers
based on [this](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/guidelines-presenter/?utm_source=sendgrid.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=website):*Lightning Talks (5 minutes): Presentations in which participants speak about their ideas, current activities, challenges and professional passions. Lightning Talks will be held during lunch breaks at the “Lightning Talk Stage”.*

# Overview
::: {.incremental}
- To answer the main question **"ML-Carp Workshop, what is that?"** let's answer three sub-questions:
  - Q1: What was done?
  - Q2: Who participated? And feelings about it.
  - Q3: ML-Carp's future?
- This talk links to upcoming sessions
  - *Upskilling researchers in Machine Learning*
  - BoF Session: *AI Skill Training Pathway: Bridging Gaps and Fostering Inclusivity*
:::

# What was done
## Background

::: {.incremental}
- Machine Learning (ML) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) are without a doubt **hot topics**
- Empowering reserachers to **understand and use** ML seems **rewarding**, but also **challenging**
- [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) ![The Carpentries](TheCarpentries.svg){ width=10% } offer a proven teaching-style accounting for participants with limited IT experience
  - Core aspects 
    - live-coding
    - positive attitude towards mistakes
    - minimal prereuisites
    - **maximising participant invovlement**
- The [CeR (Centre for eResearch)](http://eresearch.auckland.ac.nz/) at the University of Auckland acquired funding to further develop and run a series of workshops (also referred to as *ML-Carp*)
- Two iterations (referred to as *Run #1* and *Run#2*) took place so far. In March and September 2023.

- Four hour sessions over four consecutive afternoon

- Depending on Maturity, sessions were run with a **small changes** or **substantially (re)developed**.
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- One major change was [Goolge Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) ![Colab](./Google_Colaboratory_SVG_Logo.svg){ width=3% } being used instead of local Python installs.

# Who Pariticpanted And How They Liked It

::: {.incremental}
- Large sign-up numbers meant mandatory *expression of interest* and filtering
- Analysis from two perspectives follows:
  - Metrics
  - Statements
::: 

## Participants' Background

{{< embed Plots.ipynb#participants-background >}}

## Participants' OS

{{< embed Plots.ipynb#participants-os >}}

## Participants' Feelings - Metrics

{{< embed Plots.ipynb#participants-agreement >}}

## Zoom attendance

{{< embed Plots.ipynb#zoom-participance >}}


## Participants Promotion/Demotion

{{< embed Plots.ipynb#participants-recommendation >}}

## Participants' Feelings - Statements and Adjustments

<!-- - various, most without background -->
<!-- - strong Zoom attendance -->
- observation: Even at the very end of the sessions, questions, participantion and interest didn't cease


::: {.incremental}
- "*Python lesson might be separated*"
  - Run #2: Python was removed from the curriculum
- "*more breaks*"
  - Run #2: better adherence to schedule
- "*stick to one coding interface*"
  - Run #2: only Colab, VSC etc. was linked to for post-workshop engagement
:::






::: {.fragment .fade-in}

:::{.callout-note}
All statements are positively phrased; overall the results confirm a poasitive appreciation.
:::

:::

<!-- # Reflection on Run #1 and adaption
- The learning curve appeared too steep. From no coding to refined DL approaches in a few days appeared too challenging
  - (some) Python knowledge was made a prerequisite for the Run #2. That hasn't lead to a decline in registrations
  - Two (half) days of Python being removed from this run's curriculum freed up time to allow for more breaks, an even slower pace and answering more specific questions
- End of the run shouldn't imply ceasing communication with (most) participants
  - while some researchs continue to stay in touch with CeR after Run #1, to keep up the momentum of more participants, after the end of the workshop should be less of a cut and more 'faded out'
    - A curated set of links for self-study was deemed too generic with an anticipated low continued interst in fully self-motivated  
    - Slack sub channel with targeted support
    - Kaggle?
    - VSC and local Python/GPU/Nectar/... 
    - ![Comparison](ComparisonRevRun1And2.jpg) TODO: make this appear and disappear

# What participants of Run #1 said
## What 1 thing did you like and would want to see in future workshops?
- *"apply these ML techniques on the different field"*
  - hard to achieve, focus on underlying theory
- *"slower pace"*
  - removed Python from curriculum 
- *"some research paper example?"*
  - hard
- *"add some quick group exercise session or quiz"*
  - more links/examples after the run
- *"many people were online to help the students"*
  - continued with many helpers

## What 1 thing you do think we could do better?
- too fast
- separate Python 
- adhering to break schedule

  # Comparing Run #1 and #2: What metrics and people say
  - what the numbers say 
    - more people signed up (word of mouth/positive experince being shared?)
    - more of this and that
  - what the pepole say
    - instrcutors/organisers (for the sake of bervity no full quotes)
      - better balance of topics (only ML, DL vs. having to cope with Python)
    - participants
      - ... -->

# ML Carp's Future
- while specific funding (for lesson preparation and delivery) has ended, the importance of the topic continues to increase
- more sessions are planned
- maintaining momentum using dedicated [Slack sessions](https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/digital-research-skills/hacky-hour) seems promising
- Feedback about separating the Python lesson is positive
